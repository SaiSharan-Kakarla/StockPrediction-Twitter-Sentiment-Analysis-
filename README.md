# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data for Predicting Stock Market Movements

Research:
Stock market is place where people buy and sell shares of publicly listed companies. Every buyer and
seller try to predict the stock market price movements to get maximum profits and minimum losses.
Using cutting edge technology such as AI can improve prediction stock price. In the procedure of
considering strategies and variables to be considered, we found ML algorithmics such as Random Forest,
LSTM, SVM, ANN was not fully utilized. In this model we will introduce and review more a possible way
to predict stock movements with high accuracy. Predicting stock market movements is a well-known
problem of interest. Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion
about current events. Especially, twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying
the public sentiments. Stock market prediction based on public sentiments expressed on twitter has
been an intriguing field of research.

Claim:

we contribute to the field of sentiment analysis of twitter data. Sentiment classification is the task of
judging opinion in a piece of text as positive, negative or neutral. Twitter as a valuable source and a
powerful tool for conducting studies and making predictions. Data Filtration used by tokenization and
public emotions are analyzed this is called sentiment analysis. Further feature extraction is done by
using N- gram representation and word2vec representation. Human annotated tweets are fed to the
classifier and trained using random forest algorithm. Both the textual representations performed well,
and the results are comparable.
